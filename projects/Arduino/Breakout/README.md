# Breakout on the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
This c/c++ sketch for the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi microcontroller board implements a Breakout style game using the board's built-in LED matrix.

You can see a video demo of the program here: <https://addlink>

This project is an extension of an assignment from Paul McWhorter's wonderful YouTube series on programming the Uno R4 WiFi. You can see episode 30 of his series here, where students are asked to build a Pong style game using the LED Matrix:  [Lesson 30: Create a One Player Pong Game on the R4 Wifi Matrix](https://youtu.be/kiRX8chd56Q?si=xdSvrQqHsVb8fDge)

After finishing the Pong assignment somewhat quickly, a fellow student convinced me to follow that up by making a Breakout game for the Uno R4, hence the project and code you find here.
