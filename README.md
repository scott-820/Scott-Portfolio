# Scott's Portfolio
## About Me
I'm a retired tech professional with an Electrical Engineering, Functional Management and Product Management background pursuing a better understanding of topics in Computer Science and programming. Building off very early experiences with FORTRAN and Assembly language in college and personal ventures with Turbo Pascal / Turbo c/c++ in the 80's and 90's, I've more recently explored the world of physical computing with c/c++ on Arduino machines and MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

MicroPython caught my interest immediately, leading to a deeper dive into regular Python, and to the wonderful CS50P online course on Python Programming offered by Harvard through edX. My final project from that course is my first entry into this personal portfolio.

I expect to add more items to the portfolio that reflect my learning journey, many of which feature the Python Pygame library as I've found it be to an enabler for new and entertaining project ideas (and I like programming games...)

## What's Next:
I'll also add some Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico W projects that derive from assignments made in some of the many excellent lesson series produced by Paul McWhorter, who is an gifted educator and inspiring human being. You can find him on YouTube here: <https://www.youtube.com/@paulmcwhorter>

Though I've already ventured into some of the following subjects to a small degree, next up on the list for further study are:
* HTML / CSS
* JavaScript
* Django (and maybe Flask)
* SQL
* Data Analytics
